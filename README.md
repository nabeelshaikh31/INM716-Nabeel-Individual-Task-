# INM716 - Neural Style Transfer

For this project, I have used my own style-transfer code to create portraits of famous football players. I imported the style-transfer model “arbitrary-image-stylization-inceptionv3” from TensorflowHub which is a repository of trained machine learning models. I then fed the input image to the model and applied different layers of style transfer for every input image depending on the depth of the style image.
